space
nothing but me
for humanity to want and allow nature to rebalance itself
more protected national parks
wildlife such as leaves and trees
less cars
healthy lungs and room
to remind myself that it’s essential to live and thrive
oxygen
clean air
peace
trees
calmness
clean air - no cars
time
boundaries from the hustle
my inhalers ☹
clean air and nature
my health
a healthy planet
